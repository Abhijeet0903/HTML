    <p>
      <strong>Shivaji</strong> I (<i>Shivaji Shahaji Bhonsale</i>; <small>Marathi pronunciation:</small> [ʃiʋaːd͡ʒiˑ bʱoˑs(ə)leˑ]; c. 19 February 1630 – 3 April 1680<sup>[5]</sup>) was an Indian ruler and a member of the Bhonsle Maratha clan.<sup>[6]</sup> Shivaji carved out his own independent kingdom from the declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur that formed the genesis of the Maratha Empire. In 1674, he was formally crowned the Chhatrapati of his realm at Raigad Fort.<sup>[7]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the course of his life, Shivaji engaged in both alliances and hostilities with the Mughal Empire, the Sultanate of Golkonda, the Sultanate of Bijapur and the European colonial powers. Shivaji's military forces expanded the Maratha sphere of influence, capturing and building forts, and forming a Maratha navy. Shivaji established a competent and progressive civil administration with well-structured administrative institutions. He revived ancient Hindu political traditions, court conventions and promoted the use of the Marathi and Sanskrit languages, replacing Persian at court and in administration.<sup>[7][8]</sup> Praised for his ethical treatment of women,<sup>[9]</sup> Shivaji employed people of all castes and religions, including Muslims<sup>[10]</sup> and Europeans, in his administration and armed forces.<sup>[11]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      Shivaji's legacy was to vary by observer and time, but nearly two centuries after his death he began to take on increased importance with the emergence of the Indian independence movement, as many Indian nationalists elevated him as a proto-nationalist and hero of the Hindus.<sup>[12][13][14]</sup>
